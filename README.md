1. Easy to Read and Learn
Python is simple and looks like plain English. This makes it easy to learn for beginners.
Example:
print("Hello, World!")


2. Multipurpose
You can use Python for many things, like:

Building websites (e.g., with Django or Flask).
Data analysis and creating charts.
Making games or simple programs.
Automating repetitive tasks, like renaming files.


3. Interpreted Language
You don’t need to compile Python code. Just write it and run it directly.
Example:

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)  # Output: 15


4. Rich Standard Library
Python comes with many built-in tools, so you don’t have to start from scratch.
Example:

math for calculations.
datetime for working with dates and times.

import math
print(math.sqrt(9))  # Output: 3.0

5. Platform Independent
You can run Python on any computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) without changing the code.

6. Large Community and Ecosystem
Millions of people use Python, so you’ll find lots of help, tutorials, and ready-made tools for almost anything.
