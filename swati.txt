Hello. My name is Swati Jaiswal, and I am from Indore. I graduated from RGPV University in 2024.
I have over 1 year of experience in the DevOps field, and during my career, I have worked on various DevOps tools and technologies.
I have hands-on experience with version control tools like Git. I have resolved merge conflicts between branches, helped developers troubleshoot issues, and created branching strategies to ensure smooth workflows.
For CI/CD pipelines, I have worked extensively with Jenkins to automate the build, testing, and deployment process. Since our technology stack includes Java, I have used Maven as the build tool.
I have practical experience in configuration management using Ansible, where I created playbooks, executed ad-hoc commands, and worked with static inventory files to configure systems efficiently.
I have used Terraform extensively in the field of infrastructure as code (IaC). I have created and updated modules, managed state files in remote locations like S3 buckets, and ensured consistent cloud infrastructure provisioning.
Regarding containerization and orchestration, I have worked with Docker and Kubernetes. I have created Docker images, run containers, and managed repositories like Docker Hub and Amazon ECR. In Kubernetes, I have created deployments, ReplicaSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and configured services and ingress controllers for path-based routing. I also set up Kubernetes clusters using Terraform and handled administrative tasks required for hosting applications.
When it comes to cloud technologies, I have hands-on experience with AWS services such as EC2, Load Balancers, VPCs, NAT Gateways, Route Tables, VPC Peering, Auto Scaling, S3, Route 53, CloudWatch, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudFront, and CloudFormation. I’ve worked on monitoring services like CloudTrail and ensured high availability and reliability in the cloud infrastructure.
Lastly, I have worked extensively in Linux environments, where I managed services like MariaDB, NFS, file systems, partitioning, user administration, permissions, package management, and basic Linux troubleshooting.
I’m passionate about learning new tools and technologies and applying them to solve real-world challenges in DevOps.
